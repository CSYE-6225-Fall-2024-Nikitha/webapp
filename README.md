# Health Check API

## Overview
This project implements a Health Check API, followed by User creation APIs as part of a cloud-native web application assignment. The API checks the health of the application by verifying the connection to the PostgreSQL database and responds accordingly.The User API creates user, fetches and updates user

### **Web Application Updates**

- **Observability**:  
  - Logs: Application log data is stored in Amazon CloudWatch.  
  - Metrics: CloudWatch collects metrics for API usage, including the number of calls and response times.  

- **Custom Metrics**:  
  - **API Call Count**: Tracks the frequency of API calls.  
  - **API Response Time**: Measures the time taken (ms) to process each API call.  
  - **Database Query Time**: Records the execution time (ms) of database queries.  
  - **S3 Operation Time**: Tracks the duration (ms) of calls to AWS S3.  

- **API Features**:  
  - All request/response payloads are JSON.  
  - Proper HTTP status codes are returned for all operations.  
  - APIs follow authentication and authorization protocols.  

- **Image Management**:  
  - Users can upload profile pictures in formats like PNG, JPG, and JPEG.  
  - Images are stored in an S3 bucket, with metadata saved in the database.  
  - Users can delete images they added; images are removed from both S3 and the database.  
  - Image updates are unsupportedâ€”users must delete and re-upload.  

- **S3 Security**:  
  - S3 credentials are securely managed via IAM roles attached to EC2 instances.  


- **SNS Integration**: Sends a JSON payload to an SNS topic upon user account creation, enabling email verification through AWS Lambda.  
- **Account Verification**: Ensures API access is restricted for unverified users until email verification is completed.

### Deploying Application on Cloud
This document outlines the steps to launch an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS VM on DigitalOcean, set up the necessary environment, and run the application for the demo.

## Prerequisites

- A DigitalOcean account
- Access to the code submission ZIP file from Canvas

## Steps

### 1. Launch Ubuntu 24.04 LTS VM on DigitalOcean

1. **Sign In to DigitalOcean**: Go to [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and sign in to your account.
2. **Create a Droplet**:
   - Click on the **"Create"** button and select **"Droplets"**.
   - Choose **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** as the operating system.
   - Select a plan according to your resource needs.
   - Choose a data center region close to your location.
   - Set up SSH keys or password for authentication.
   - Click **"Create Droplet"**.

### 2. Download Code Submission and SCP to the VM

1. **Download Code**: Obtain the ZIP file containing the code submission from Canvas.
2. **Transfer ZIP to VM**:
   - Open a terminal on your local machine.
   - Use `scp` to copy the ZIP file to your VM:
     ```bash
     scp /path/to/your/code.zip root@your_droplet_ip:/path/on/vm
     ```

### 3. Install PostgreSQL RDBMS

1. **Connect to Your VM**:
   ```bash
   ssh root@your_droplet_ip
2. **Update Package List**:
  ```
   sudo apt update
   ```
3. **Install PostgreSQL**:
```
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib

```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
```
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```
5. **Build Application**:
```
unzip /path/on/vm/code.zip -d /path/on/vm/code
cd /path/on/vm/code
```
6. **Install Node.js Dependencies**:
```
npm install
```
7. **Update Application Configuration**:
- Manually update the application configuration in the external configuration file as needed.

- Ensure that you do not modify any source files.

8. **Launch the Application**:
```
npm start

```
9. **Validate Application Health**
```
curl http://localhost:your_port/healthz
```
10. **Test USER API Operations**
- Perform tests for all USER API operations (like create, read, update, delete) using tools like Postman or curl.
- Ensure that the database is set up automatically without executing any SQL scripts manually.

## PACKER - FOR BUILDING CUSTOM  IMAGES

**Building a Custom Application Image Using Packer**
- This  will show how to use Packer to build a custom image for our application using Ubuntu 24.04 LTS as the base image. The custom image will include the necessary application dependencies, the database (MySQL/MariaDB/PostgreSQL), and configuration files.

**Prerequisites**

Before proceeding, ensure that you have the following setup:

- Packer installed on your local machine.
- AWS CLI configured with access to your DEV AWS account.
- A VPC set up in your DEV AWS account.
- Access to the repository where the Packer template will be stored alongside the web application code.

**Steps to Build a Custom Image**
- Install Packer:
- create a packer/ directory to store your Packer template.
- The template should include configurations for:
- The Ubuntu 24.04 LTS base image.
- Installing all necessary dependencies for the web application (e.g., Java, Python, Tomcat, etc.).
- Starting services (e.g., systemctl enable <service_name>).
- Ensuring that the services are started on instance launch.
- **Make the Image Private**: Ensure that all custom images created are marked as private. This restricts access so that only you can launch instances from it.
- Store the Packer template within the repository. The packer/ directory can be added at the root level of your application repository.
**Build the Custom Image**

Run the following Packer commands to build and validate the custom image:

Format the Packer template:
```
packer fmt packer-template.pkr.hcl
```
Validate the Packer template:

```
packer validate -var-file=dev.tfvars packer-template.pkr.hcl
```
Build the custom image:
```
packer build -var-file=dev.tfvars packer-template.pkr.hcl
```
**Using dev.tfvars for Packer Configuration**

- For this project, we will use Packer to build custom application images and manage environment-specific variables (such as AWS region, instance type, etc.) via a dev.tfvars file.
-  This makes it easy to maintain separate configurations for different environments (e.g., dev, prod, etc.).
```
dev.tfvars
aws_region = "us-east-1"
source_ami = "ami-<ubuntu-24.04-id>"
instance_type = "t2.micro"
```

**Configure Image Launch in AWS**:

- The custom image build should happen in your DEV AWS account and within the default VPC.
- Once the image is built, ensure the correct security groups are configured when launching instances from it.

**Running the Application on the Custom Image**
- When the custom image is launched, it should already have MySQL/MariaDB/PostgreSQL installed and running, and all application dependencies should be in place.
- Ensure that the application starts as a service using systemd when the instance is launched.



### Additional Notes
- Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running before starting the application.

- Any API requests that are not GET will return a 405 Method Not Allowed status.

- If there is any payload in the request body, a 400 Bad Request response will be sent.




### Instructions:
- Fill in the placeholders in the `.env` file template with actual values.
